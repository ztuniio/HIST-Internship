<p id="para9">The World Wide Web (WWW or Web) is a system of interlinked, hypertext documents that are accessed through the internet. It was created in 1989 by Sir Tim Berners-Lee and is now an integral part of the internet, serving as a vast platform for information and communication.

The World Wide Web uses the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) to structure and present information on the internet. Web browsers, such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Apple Safari, are used to access and display the information on web pages.

The Web has dramatically changed the way people access and share information, connect with others, and conduct business. It has become a global marketplace, an entertainment hub, an educational resource, and a platform for political and social communication. The Web continues to evolve and has brought about new opportunities and challenges in areas such as privacy, security, and accessibility.</p>
