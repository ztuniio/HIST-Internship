			The "deep web" refers to all parts of the internet that are not indexed by search engines and are not easily accessible through normal web browsers. This includes anything that requires authentication, such as online banking, email services, or subscription-based content, as well as anything that is not linked to from other websites.

			The deep web is often confused with the "dark web," but the two are different. While the dark web is a subset of the deep web and requires specific software to access, the majority of the deep web is legal and harmless. In fact, estimates suggest that the deep web is significantly larger than the "surface web" that is indexed by search engines.

			Many people use the deep web every day without realizing it, such as when they access their online bank accounts or use private messaging services. While the deep web does contain some illegal content, it is not inherently dangerous or nefarious, and much of it is simply content that is not meant to be publicly accessible.

<h2>is dark web</h2>

		<div class="col-6" font="italic" style="background-color: lightblue;">
			<p>
			The "dark web" is a part of the internet that is not indexed by search engines and is only accessible through specialized software such as Tor (The Onion Router). It is a network of encrypted and anonymous websites that can only be accessed with specific authorization, such as a particular URL or a password.

			The dark web is often associated with illegal activities such as drug trafficking, weapons trading, and other forms of criminal activity. However, it is also used for legitimate purposes, such as providing a safe and anonymous space for whistleblowers, journalists, and activists.

			It's important to note that while the dark web has a reputation for being a hotbed of criminal activity, the vast majority of online criminal activity takes place on the regular web. Nonetheless, due to the anonymity and secrecy it provides, the dark web remains an attractive platform for cybercriminals, and accessing it without proper precautions can be risky.
